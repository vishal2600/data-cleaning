<ul>
<li><p><code>CodeBook.md</code> a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data</p></li>
<li><code>run_analysis.R</code> performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course projectâ€™s definition:
<ul>
<li>Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.</li>
<li>Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.</li>
<li>Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set</li>
<li>Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.</li>
<li>From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><code>FinalData.txt</code> is the exported final data after going through all the sequences described above.</p></li>
</ul>
